# Solar-Power-Generation-for-Home

Project Description:
As part of the Solar Cells & Photovoltaic Systems course (EE 404), I collaborated with my colleague, Hamza Alashi, on an impactful project aimed at harnessing the power of the sun for sustainable energy generation. Under the supervision of Dr. Noura Alhazmi, our project focused on implementing our acquired knowledge and producing a useful application.

Our main goal was to utilize photovoltaic (PV) solar cells to generate efficient and sustainable electrical energy for homes. We developed a comprehensive system that involved capturing direct current (DC) from solar PV panels and transforming it into 220 V alternating current (AC) for household consumption. To ensure stability and consistency in the output signal, we incorporated power electronics circuits such as a DC/DC Boost Converter and a DC/AC Inverter, along with capacitors to reduce ripples.

Simulink played a vital role in our project, enabling us to bring our system to life through simulations. We fine-tuned and optimized the performance of our power electronics circuits by leveraging the capabilities of Simulink. This iterative process allowed us to make significant improvements based on the simulation results.

Our project seamlessly blended theoretical concepts from our coursework in Renewable Energy and Power Electronics with hands-on experience. It was inspiring to witness how classroom learning translated into impactful solutions. By combining our knowledge and practical skills, we successfully demonstrated the potential of solar power generation for sustainable and eco-friendly homes.
